# ReactJS JSX

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start
```

1. Modify the my-app/src/App.js to have an image with a URL instead of an import

2. Create a constant with an array of strings inside the render() function inside App.js

3. Create another constant that is a map of the array that displays a div around each string and apply a unique key to each div.

4. Do the same as the previous step but use React.createElement instead of the div directly.

5. Add both of the mapped array constants into the return of the render() function.

6. View the page that was opened during the setup to see the results of your changes.

After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS JSX Examples"
```
